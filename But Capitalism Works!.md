##Introduction

We live in a broken world. There are a number of problems in our society and governmental system that we complain about (or worse, tolerate) and seem to have no real cause for its deeply-rooted existence in our world. I will analyse some of these problems and the extent to which they are caused or influenced by our capitalist system. I won't be assessing how best to eliminate these problems, only looking at how they are caused/exacerbated through capitalism in its current form. This page is not meant to be a definitive resource - it's merely an introduction to the failures of capitalism.
