        <p>I want you to read this letter at your own leisure, preferably with no distractions. It&rsquo;s your letter - you can read it as much as you like. I really wanted to give you a paper copy of this, but I guess it doesn&rsquo;t really make much of a difference if it&rsquo;s digital — you can read it whenever you want this way.</p>
        
        <p>Truthfully, I&rsquo;m writing this to make you feel special; I guess I just want to put a smile on the face that’s put one on mine so much. There&rsquo;ll also be some things in here that I never want you to forget — whether that&rsquo;s because you reread it as you so often do or I just remind you lol. I don&rsquo;t expect this to turn a bad day good or a regular day &ldquo;epic&rdquo; — of course that&rsquo;s not going to happen so easily. There&rsquo;s just a few things I want you to know, which will hopefully make you laugh (or at least grin, maybe, but still) and probably make you feel a bit better — even if it&rsquo;s a silly laugh. Of course, if you still feel sad after, that&rsquo;s completely fine (except it&rsquo;s your birthday, no the hell it is not fine). I know you&rsquo;re probably going to deny or sarcastically joke about a lot of the stuff I&rsquo;m going to say but could you do me a solid. While you&rsquo;re reading this, could you write your comments separately and then tell me them all so we can both have a funny. Even if it isn&rsquo;t, just pretend it is. Please. For me.</p>

        <p>First thing I want to tell you is: <strong>I love you &lt;3.</strong> And I know I say it often, and that that tends to dilute its meaning, but it&rsquo;s as sincere as can be. Honest. Yes, I mostly only know you from the internet, and yes I probably don&rsquo;t interact with you as much as your other friends might, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I care about you any less. You are a damn good friend, and for that you are loved as you deserve — but hear me out anyway. </p>

        <p>You are vastly more spectacular than you let on. You must know you have so many positive aspects; you tend to downplay or ignore them and allow yourself to grow anxious over little things. You’re so <u>intelligent</u>; you can always look at a situation and break it down, and know what to do a lot of the time. You’re really smart and the people around you know it — you should take pride in that! Even if you’re telling yourself right now that I’m making it up, it’s still so true. Believe me. You know you’re really smart unicorn; don’t try to deny it smh. Don’t you dare say you’re dumb, ok — because you aren’t. You’re so <u>empathetic</u>; you always know how others are feeling and take that into account when talking to them, and you try to make things better for other people. You always check up on me and ask if I’m ok whenever I’m feeling down, and you say stuff as it is when you have to. Your compassion really knows no bounds, even if sometimes you get angry at your siblings, you clearly still feel bad about that which shows you care. You’re so <u>joyful</u>; everyone has a good time when you’re around, and appreciates you more than they’d say. You can always make people laugh and get along well with pretty much everyone. I genuinely can’t think of anyone who has a reason to dislike you; you just don’t give anyone that opportunity.</p>

        <p>I know it’s really hard to see these types of things in yourself, but honestly they (and so many more) really do show. There’s a reason why so many people enjoy your company and are friends with you, and you should never let yourself forget the sheer effort you put in to make that happen. You are a brilliant woman no matter what obstacles you’ve faced along the way — there’s a case to be made that those obstacles display that you’re capable of even more strength than otherwise. It might often cross your mind that you’re weird or annoying or a burden or will cause someone concern or whatever but you’re none of those things. To me you’re amazing and funny, intelligent and considerate and I can’t think of anyone who I appreciate as fully or love as much.</p>

        <p>I know this reads like a joke, but believe me when I say that I mean every word of it. Nothing in the world is better than a good friend, and you’re the best friend I could ever ask for. I don’t know what I’d do without you. <strong>I love you Sana &lt;3.</strong></p>

        <p>You are amazing. You are brilliant. You are very loved. Remember that.</p>
